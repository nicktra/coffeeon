        'We can’t help but compare Kopi Janji Jiwa with Kopi Kenangan, because both have a similar galau theme (the brand itself is roughly translated as “Soul Promise Coffee”). Their menu is like a merged version of the ones at Kopi Kenangan and Kedai Kopi Kulo, with iced avocado coffee and milk tea variants such as hojicha and matcha. We consider ourselves to be heavy coffee drinkers, but even we thought that Kopi Janji Jiwa’s Es Kopi Susu is much more bitter, heavier, and darker than its compatriots. One time, we ordered their Es Kopi Soklat (think of it like the mocha version of es kopi) and we couldn’t gulp it due to its thick texture, even after adding ice cubes. Good thing is, they have soy coffee latte and soy matcha latte and fresher variants like Es Yoghurt Yuzu if you’ve had enough of lactose.',

        'Keeping in line with the galau theme — Indonesian slang meaning “confusion,” but usually associated with heartbreak — all their coffee and tea-based drinks have sappy names (Kopi Kenangan is roughly translated as “Memories Coffee”). For example, their signature es kopi is “Kopi Kenangan Mantan (Memories of an Ex-lover coffee),” the variant of flavored lattes is named “Kopi Mantan Menikah (Ex-lover Getting Married coffee), and the Baileys-flavored coffee is “Kopi Lupakan Dia (Forget Him/Her coffee)”. The Kopi Kenangan Mantan itself is pretty good, more on the bitter note with the right amount of sweetness, just like the bittersweet memories of your ex.',

        'The OG es kopi: Toko Kopi Tuku is the first ever coffee shop to sell the first es kopi of its kind in Indonesia. First opened in 2015 with a small store in Cipete area, South Jakarta, Tuku was intended to be a “neighborhood coffee shop,” selling a variety of affordable kopi and the usual cappuccino, et al. The classic Es Kopi Susu Tetangga (neighbor’s es kopi with milk) — a mixture of iced latte, creamer, and liquid coconut sugar (gula aren in Indonesian) — became a hit. In 2017, Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited its Cipete store, which further propelled Tuku to its meteoric fame. If you ask us, Tuku is still our favorite to this day. We even have our secret recipe for a stronger es kopi: double the shot with less coconut sugar.',

Plus, they have their own mobile app for coffee pre-order and vouchers, too — pretty impressive for a coffee chain that was only launched in August of last year. Just like any other third-wave coffee shops, Fore is serving variety of espresso-based drinks and manual brew coffee. It’s not es kopi per se — but Fore’s rose, pandan, watermelon(!), and roasted iced lattes might count as well. The first three might be for those who have an acquired taste for those flavors, and the last one is for people who like to have their iced latte sweetened (we won’t judge! This is a safe space for any kind of coffee lover).',

The shop got its name from the Minang language — sagaleh means “segelas” (a cup or a glass). Their house blend is a mixture of eight (EIGHT!) different beans, and they use regular cane sugar to sweeten the drink. You can also customize how much coffee, as well as the sugar level (low, medium, high) of your es kopi. We usually have our es kopi Sagaleh with less sugar, so that the coffee taste can stand out more.',

Owned by German-Indonesian actor Nino Fernandez, Dibawahtangga is well-liked among Jakarta’s coffee drinkers for its balanced sweet and milky flavor.
